For this reason, PFM-1 was nicknamed "Child Killer". Since then, the hull of the mine has been significantly altered. However, like most of the other decommissioned weapons, these mines have migrated from the Great Earth to the zone. It is mainly valued for its functionality, convenience, compact size and light weight. The disadvantage is a small amount of explosives, its power is not enough to kill a heavily armed stalker by an explosion alone.

Of course, he later collected a lot of artifacts, but at the cost of everything was formed in his stomach a huge tumor. Frequent vomiting, diarrhea, constant stress... He looked like a pregnant woman, but instead of a child in his stomach developed a huge malignant tumor. He even named it after his first pet. I certainly didn't mind. I liked him, we formed a good company.

There must have been a huge number of artifacts, but no one wanted to go there with us for some reason. "Cowards and fools" we thought then. Why didn't anyone want to get rich and live an easy life? Then a sudden rush of courage came upon us, we immediately gathered and went straight to the cave. We didn't even have time to look into the cave, as some dark shadow flew over us. I tripped, hit my head and passed out. After a while I came to my senses and heard someone moaning. "Animals," as I initially thought, but then suddenly realized that my friend was lying and moaning in front of me. His skin was torn all over his body, his bleeding wounds could see all the muscles. He crawled from the cave himself, conscious, dragging his guts behind him... It was a miracle he didn't die on the spot. I didn't understand anything, I pulled out my gun and started shooting towards that cave. I had 20 rounds of ammunition for the gun when I had seven rounds left - something grabbed my arm. I kept shooting, pulling the trigger convulsively. After a moment my grip loosened, but I kept pulling the trigger even when I ran out of ammo. At the time, I didn't even realize what I had just done to my friend. I didn't even have the guts to pick up his stuff, I just ran. How after this I could talk to someone or make new acquaintances, when the zone at any moment can repeat his evil joke. It's better to be alone. Friendship has its price and risk. It is not necessary to start especially warm friendships, because all this can be lost in a moment.

Scientific data have shown that their brain does not conduct any thought processes and the neurological activity of the brain structure is virtually non-existent, which confirms the fact of the death of brain cells to a critical level. However, field tests have proved that for reasons unknown to science, their dead brain is able to give pulses for simple mechanical reactions (something resembling instincts, but with significant differences in logic of behavior). According to one version, this is due to the result of endless neurochemical reactions in the body, which cause the body to move in a certain way in response to certain specific stimuli. When they are threatened by something, they demonstrate extremely aggressive behavior, so it is better to approach them with great care. Tests have shown that their physiology is so altered that tissues are able to independently maintain neural communication, i.e. even the parts separated from the body can function independently without receiving any nutrients to generate energy. One of the most successful such experiments is maintaining the capacity of the liver and heart for 3 months without binding and connections with other organs and circulation.

It is quite possible to use other simple tools and technological devices.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]The terms "kill" and "destroy" in contact with deactivated samples should not be used. This is largely due to the psychological point of view, because the term "decontamination" is more neutral than "destruction", thus avoiding the burden on the psyche and suppressing the feeling of remorse. Deactivation of the sample requires interruption of connections of the brain with the musculoskeletal apparatus, which is preferable to do a ballistic injury in the area of the brain or spinal cord. Each member of the scientific team should keep in mind that they of course remain functional even after the sample is deactivated, so additional security measures should be taken.

If a meeting with stalkers is inevitable, two options can be taken to avoid a combat clash. First, when working in a group with a novice stalker should not cut the eyes of the sample - it is simply inhumane. Secondly, when working in a group with a stalker-veteran it is better to motivate him with something, as they suppress emotions more restrainedly.

		<text>The drug from the set of an individual first-aid kit (AI4), radioprotective agent No. 2 - 10 tablets of potassium iodide 0.25 each in a white pencil case. Radioprotective agent No. 2 is intended for persons in the zone of radioactive fallout: it blocks the thyroid gland for radioactive iodine, which comes from the breath, food and water. Take 1 tablet on an empty stomach for 10 days (in peacetime, in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant, take all the time and another 8 days after the last discharge). Radioactive iodine, with a half-life of 8 days, entering the human body during atomic explosions and accidents replaces normal iodine in the body, which usually accumulates in the thyroid gland as necessary for its functioning, which as a result can lead to thyroid cancer. Diffuse toxic goiter and thyroiditis - diseases of the immune system - can be the harbingers of cancer. Typical signs of diffuse toxic goiter: irritability, weakness, palpitations, lack of concentration, tearfulness, decreased performance, pain in the eyes, enlargement and bulging of the eyes, fussiness. It is known that an effective counteraction is potassium iodide, which saturates the thyroid gland with iodine and prevents the entry of the radionuclide into it.

The irony is that the idea for such a product came to Russia during World War II in the form of aid from the United States. Since then, various types of stew have become the main means of long-term storage of meat, which is used by both the civilian population and the ranks of the army. It should be noted that, despite the long shelf life, the stew has a high nutritional value (due to its high fat content) and a relatively good taste. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has seen many varieties of stew. Since the spring of 2013, minced meat of the Abakan brand remains the undoubted leader among other canned food.
